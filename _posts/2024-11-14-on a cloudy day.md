On A Cloudy Day 
2024-11-14

It feels so sad today, but I want to do so much. I want to read but I also want to write. I want to crochet but I also want to do my nails. I want to play with my cat but she doesn't want to play with me. I want to clean my room, whatever that might mean. 

Cleaning my room makes me mean. Why? I wouldn't know.

It seems like a chore; unnecessary, busy work, not beneficial to my wellbeing. 

Why is something so fundamentaly simple so extremely difficult. 

Shouldn't I immediately clean up the second I see a mess? Isn't that how my brain should work?

Should. 

Yes, should. A hated word, but how else might I explain something I must do, but simply do not want to? 

This seems like something my mind and body should already know how to do, it should be trained in it, and a pro.

A master.

Mastery. 

Do we ever really master a thing? Or multiple? 

As humans, can we truly master something, anything?

They always say humans make mistakes. 

So why are we told to evade a simple mistake?

They say you learn through making mistakes. 

So why are we punished when we make a simple mistake?

Mistake. 

Am I saying that too much?

My mistake. Let's bring it back. To today. The sad cloudy day. 

Is it wrong that I feel secure in this sadness. That I feel confident within this cloud. 

This cloud I have been waiting to be in. 

Since being in a burning sun for the past few months. 

Finally, I feel aleviated. 

I feel whole. 

Sadness makes me feel whole. 

Am I saying that word too much? Sad? 

It saddens me that this may irritate you. 

Are you irritated?

Envigorated? 

With me?

The person behind the screen?

Will you yell at me?

Call me nasty things?

Is it because I see you? Because I see right through you. I see all the things you don't want me to see. 
I look at you and I know you. I know the things you've been through. The things you do. The things you wish you never did. The things you hope to do. I can incriminate you. But I choose not to. Because maybe, that would be a mistake. And it would make you sad. And angry with me. The person you do not know. But the person that wholly knows you.

I guess these are just the things I'm thinking. 

On this cloudy day. 

I guess I did one thing. 

I wrote. 

Now to decide what's next.

This constant circle, of trying to find the next thing to do. 

The next thing I have to do. The next thing I want to do. The next thing I should do. On this cloudy day. 

Only on this cloudy day. 

This sad

lonely

cloudy

day.
